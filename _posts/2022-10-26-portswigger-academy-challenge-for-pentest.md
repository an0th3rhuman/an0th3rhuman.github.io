### Why Bugbounty is hard?

As a triager, I noticed the Bugbounty trend got changed. The skill is important as well as how you fine-tune the tools you got in your arsenal. It is a battle between you and other smart people and sometimes the tools you are battling with. The efficient strategy finally wins.  I can see many felt sad and quit bug bounty just because they got a couple of duplicates.

If you got duplicates, it's not because you have hard worked enough, but because you failed to do smart work.

### How can we solve it?

I have planned to write a series of blog posts containing solutions for Portswigger Academy labs. The labs will be solved and solutions will be provided by using Burpsuite, custom python scripts, and a custom Nuceli template.

In this way, we can practice ourselves and write our custom tools and speed up and automate our testing process.
